# MLOpsReviews

Welcome to my content recommendation system. In this repository, you will find 2 jupyter files named 'MVP 1' and 'MVP 2' where I prepare all the necessary data that was later saved in the files 'data_api.csv' and 'data_ML.csv' correspondingly. All the 7 endpoints can be found in the 'main.py' file.
